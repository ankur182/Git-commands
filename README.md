Great question! You’re referring to this line in your Employee.java:

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "employerId") // other things -> employer table variables
@JsonBackReference
private Employer employer;

Let’s break down what @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") means and what happens if you use other column names like panNo, estDate, or location.


---

1. What does @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") do?

It tells Hibernate:

> “In the Employee table, there will be a foreign key column named employerId, which refers to the Employer table’s employerId primary key.”



So in DB terms:

Employee table gets a column employerId

This column is a foreign key to Employer.employerId



---

2. What happens if you write @JoinColumn(name = "panNo") or location, etc.?

Hibernate will assume:

The foreign key column in Employee table is named panNo

It will still point to the Employer table, but by default it matches against the PK of Employer


Is this valid?

Technically: Yes But only if:

panNo exists in the Employee table (as a foreign key column)

It still references employerId (unless you override that)


Otherwise: Error on save / schema validation


---

3. What if I actually want to join on panNo (a non-PK column)?

You must explicitly tell Hibernate what column in Employer to use:

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "panNo", referencedColumnName = "panNo")
private Employer employer;

This means:

In the Employee table, there will be a column called panNo

It references the Employer.panNo column

panNo in Employer must be unique, or it’ll throw a data integrity error

4. Summary of Scenarios

@JoinColumn Value	Expected Behavior

employerId	FK from Employee to Employer.employerId (default, safe)
panNo	Treated as FK column in Employee, still targets Employer PK unless referencedColumnName used
panNo with referencedColumnName = "panNo"	Valid only if Employer.panNo is unique
Invalid column	Hibernate error or DB constraint failure



---

5. Recommendation

Stick with:

@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")

Unless you have a strong reason to join on another column and ensure:

That other column (panNo, location, etc.) is unique

You use referencedColumnName correctly

Let me know if you want to try a custom join or get a schema diagram showing how FK links behave.
