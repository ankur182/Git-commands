Great question! Let's break this down in simple words.

From your image, the Employee class has:

@ManyToOne  
@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")  
@JsonBackReference  
private Employer employer;

This means:

You're telling Hibernate: "In the employee table, create a foreign key column called employerId that links to the primary key of the employer table".



---

Now, what if you try to use @JoinColumn(name = "panNo") or location, etc.?

Case 1: @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") ✅ (CORRECT)

employerId must be the @Id (primary key) in Employer.

Hibernate creates the relationship using the employerId column.

Everything works fine — no errors.


Case 2: @JoinColumn(name = "panNo") ❌ (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Hibernate tries to link employee.panNo to employer.panNo.

But panNo is not a primary key or a unique column (by default).

This may cause:

Error: “Cannot reference non-primary key column” unless you make it @Column(unique = true) and set @JoinColumn(referencedColumnName = "panNo")

Or unexpected joins/bugs in data mapping



Case 3: @JoinColumn(name = "estDate") or location ❌

Same issue: Hibernate can't join on non-unique, non-primary columns.

It doesn't know how to uniquely identify the parent.



---

If You REALLY Want to Join on panNo

You must do this:

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "panNo", referencedColumnName = "panNo")
private Employer employer;

And in the Employer class:

@Column(unique = true)
private String panNo;

But again — not recommended unless panNo is truly a unique, never-changing ID (like an Aadhaar, PAN, etc.)


---

Best Practice

Always use:

@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")

Because:

It’s the primary key

Auto-generated and indexed

Avoids relational mapping errors

Summary Table

Join Column	Works?	Why / Why Not

employerId	Yes	Primary key in Employer, default and best choice
panNo	Maybe	Only works with @Column(unique = true) and referencedColumnName
estDate / others	No	Not unique or primary — can’t reliably map child to parent


Let me know if you want to test this in Postman or see how Hibernate generates the DB table for each case.
