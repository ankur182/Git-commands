Perfect! Now let’s wrap it up with the most commonly used cascade setting:


---

CascadeType.ALL

What it does:

CascadeType.ALL is a shortcut that applies all cascade operations to the child entities:

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

This means: It includes the following:

Included Types	Description

PERSIST	Save child when parent is saved
MERGE	Update child when parent is updated
REMOVE	Delete child when parent is deleted
REFRESH	Refresh child from DB when parent is refreshed
DETACH	Detach child when parent is detached



---

Real Example in Your App (Employer → Employee)

Suppose you send this JSON via Postman to /employers:

{
  "employerId": 1,
  "panNo": "ABCDE1234F",
  "estDate": "2020-01-01",
  "location": "Delhi",
  "employees": [
    {
      "empId": 101,
      "empName": "Ankur",
      "empSalary": 50000
    },
    {
      "empId": 102,
      "empName": "Neha",
      "empSalary": 60000
    }
  ]
}

Behavior with CascadeType.ALL:

All employees in the list are saved automatically with the employer (PERSIST)

If you later update any employee name and save employer → it’s also updated (MERGE)

If you delete the employer → all associated employees are deleted too (REMOVE)

If you refresh or detach the employer → same applies to all employees (REFRESH, DETACH)



---

When to Use:

Use CascadeType.ALL when:

You always want all related child entities to follow the parent (save, update, delete, etc.)

You fully control both parent and child in your logic


BUT: Be careful — deleting a parent will delete all its children too.

Summary:

Action on Employer	Effect on Employees (with CascadeType.ALL)

Save	Employees auto-saved
Update	Employees auto-updated
Delete	Employees auto-deleted
Detach	Employees auto-detached
Refresh	Employees auto-refreshed from DB
