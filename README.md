Awesome! Now let’s understand CascadeType.REFRESH in your Employer–Employee setup.


---

What CascadeType.REFRESH Does:

When you call .refresh() on the parent entity (Employer), Hibernate also refreshes all associated child entities (Employees) from the database — overriding any in-memory (unsaved) changes.


---

Your Setup:

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = CascadeType.REFRESH)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();


---

How It Works:

Assume you load an Employer and its employees into memory, and then change some field values manually without saving.

If you now call:

entityManager.refresh(employer);

Then:

The Employer object will be reloaded from the DB.

All its associated Employee objects will also be reloaded from the DB.

Any unsaved changes in memory will be discarded.



---

Example Scenario (without Postman)

Let’s say:

1. You fetch Employer with ID 1.


2. You change the Employer name and an Employee’s name in Java code (but do not call save).


3. Then you call entityManager.refresh(employer).



Result:

All changes in memory are discarded.

Data is reloaded fresh from the DB.



---

What if CascadeType.REFRESH is NOT used?

Only the Employer entity will refresh from DB.

The associated Employee list will not be refreshed.

This can cause inconsistent data in memory — parent is updated, children are not.



---

When to Use:

When you want to ensure consistency between parent and child objects by syncing both from the database.

Less common in APIs, more relevant in transactional desktop/server-side apps or batch jobs.



---

Summary Table:

Case	Cascade.REFRESH Present	Cascade.REFRESH Absent

entityManager.refresh(employer)	Employer and all Employees reloaded from DB	Only Employer reloaded



---

Conclusion:

Use CascadeType.REFRESH when you want child records to be reloaded from the DB whenever the parent is refreshed — useful for discarding unsaved changes.
