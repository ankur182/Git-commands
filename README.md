Hi, I’m Ankur Gautam, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science from DTU.
During college, I focused a lot on Data Structures and Algorithms, and also explored frontend development by building projects like a Zoom clone, a restaurant website, and a fitness app.

Since stepping into the corporate environment, my interest has shifted more towards backend development, and I’m currently deepening my understanding of Java and Spring Boot.

Outside of work, I’ve recently picked up gymming, which has helped me maintain a healthy routine — though it's tough to always eat clean in a city like Mumbai! I also enjoy playing sports with my colleagues.
I’m always eager to learn, take ownership, and grow both technically and personally.
