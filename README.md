Great! Let’s explore the last one: CascadeType.DETACH in your Employer–Employee example.


---

What CascadeType.DETACH Does:

When the parent entity (Employer) is detached from the persistence context (i.e., Hibernate session), it also detaches the associated child entities (Employees) if CascadeType.DETACH is used.

This means:
Hibernate will stop tracking changes to both Employer and its Employees.


---

Your Setup:

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = CascadeType.DETACH)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();


---

Use Case:

entityManager.detach(employer);

What Happens:

Employer is removed from the persistence context (detached).

Because of CascadeType.DETACH, all its associated Employees are also detached.

Any changes made to these detached objects won’t be saved unless you explicitly reattach them using merge().



---

What if CascadeType.DETACH is NOT used?

Only Employer is detached.

Employees remain managed by Hibernate.

You might accidentally save child updates even though the parent is detached — this causes unexpected behavior or inconsistency.



---

Example:

You fetch Employer with ID 1, and then call:

entityManager.detach(employer);

Then:

If CascadeType.DETACH is used → Employees will also be detached.

If not used → Only Employer is detached, Employees still tracked.



---

When to Use:

When you want to completely remove the entire object graph from persistence tracking — e.g., in caching, custom lifecycle control, or specific advanced cases.


Note: Not common in REST API (Postman) use — mostly used in backend service logic or custom transaction control.


---

Summary Table:

Case	Cascade.DETACH Present	Cascade.DETACH Absent

entityManager.detach(employer)	Employer + Employees detached	Only Employer detached
Changes after detach	Not saved	Children might still be saved



---

Conclusion:

Use CascadeType.DETACH when you want to fully detach both parent and children from Hibernate's tracking. Rarely used in basic CRUD APIs.

Would you like a summary table of all cascade types and when to use them now?
