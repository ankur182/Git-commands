Great! Let’s now focus only on CascadeType.PERSIST to understand it thoroughly.


---

Scenario: Only CascadeType.PERSIST

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();


---

What it does:

When you call save() on the Employer, all new (unsaved) Employee objects associated with it will also be automatically saved to the database.


---

Postman Test Case (POST Request)

Endpoint:

POST http://localhost:8080/api/employers

Request Body:

{
  "employerId": 1,
  "panNo": "ABCPK1234X",
  "estDate": "2022-01-01",
  "location": "Delhi",
  "employees": [
    {
      "empId": 101,
      "name": "Ankur",
      "age": 24,
      "salary": 50000
    }
  ]
}

Expected Result:

Employer will be inserted in the employer table.

Employee(s) will also be inserted in the employee table automatically.

You don't need to save Employee separately via employeeRepository.



---

What if CascadeType.PERSIST is NOT used?

Then you will get an error like:

javax.persistence.PersistenceException: 
org.hibernate.TransientPropertyValueException: 
object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing

Reason:

JPA is trying to save the Employer.

But it sees related Employees that haven’t been saved yet.

Since there's no cascade = PERSIST, it won't automatically persist Employees.

So, it throws an error saying: "you’re referencing an unsaved object."



---

Quick Notes:

Case	Cascade.PERSIST Present	Cascade.PERSIST Absent

Employer saved with unsaved employees	Works fine – all saved	Fails – throws TransientPropertyValueException
Employer saved with already saved employees	Works	Works
Only employee saved	No effect on employer	No effect on employer



---

Conclusion:

Use cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST when you want to automatically persist the child (Employee) while saving the parent (Employer). Otherwise, you'll need to manually save all Employees before saving the Employer.


---

Let me know if you want to test this practically or move to the next cascade type like MERGE.


_--------------
Perfect! Let’s now go through CascadeType.MERGE in detail with your Employer and Employee setup.


---

Scenario: Only CascadeType.MERGE

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = CascadeType.MERGE)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();


---

What MERGE does:

When you update (merge) an existing Employer, it also updates the associated Employee records automatically.


---

Use Case (Postman - PUT request)

Say your database already has:

Employer with employerId = 1

Employee with empId = 101 under this employer



---

Now, you send this PUT request:

PUT http://localhost:8080/api/employers/1

Request Body:

{
  "employerId": 1,
  "panNo": "NEWPAN9999",
  "estDate": "2023-03-03",
  "location": "Mumbai",
  "employees": [
    {
      "empId": 101,
      "name": "Ankur Updated",
      "age": 25,
      "salary": 55000
    }
  ]
}


---

What will happen:

Employer’s details will be updated.

Because of CascadeType.MERGE, the Employee (empId=101) will also be updated automatically.

Hibernate does this using entityManager.merge() under the hood.



---

What if CascadeType.MERGE is NOT used?

Then the Employer would be updated, but the Employee will not be updated in DB — no error will be thrown, but the child records remain unchanged unless you manually merge/update them.


---

Summary Table:

Case	Cascade.MERGE Present	Cascade.MERGE Absent

Updating Employer + Employee together	Both updated	Only Employer updated
Updating only Employer	Works	Works
Updating only Employee	No effect on Employer	No effect on Employer



---

Conclusion:

Use CascadeType.MERGE when you want to update both parent and children in one go via the parent.
Otherwise, you'll need to update child (Employee) entities manually.
