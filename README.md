Great! Let’s now look at CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE — which is specific to Hibernate, not standard JPA.


---

What is CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE?

It tells Hibernate:
“When the parent is saved or updated, also save or update the child entities.”


Equivalent to a combination of CascadeType.PERSIST + CascadeType.MERGE in JPA.


---

Where it's used:

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employer", cascade = org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE)
@JsonManagedReference
private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

Note:
You must import Hibernate’s annotation:

import org.hibernate.annotations.Cascade;

And apply like this:

@Cascade(org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE)


---

Scenario in Your Case (Employer–Employee)

1. Add a new Employee to an existing Employer

If you modify the Employer or add new Employees, and then save Employer, Hibernate automatically saves the new Employee too.


2. Update an Employee’s name

If the Employer is updated via repository and this cascade is enabled, the Employee's updated info will also be saved.



---

What if not used?

You must explicitly save/update the child (Employee) using its repository.

If you forget to do that → changes in child are ignored.



---

Postman Example:

Suppose you send a PUT request in Postman to update Employer and also change an Employee name inside the same JSON.

With SAVE_UPDATE, both changes are saved automatically.

Without it, only Employer updates are saved unless you save Employee separately.



---

When to Use:

Use SAVE_UPDATE when:

You want to automatically persist or update child objects with parent.

You’re using Hibernate-specific features (not portable to other JPA providers).



---

Summary Table:

Case	With SAVE_UPDATE	Without SAVE_UPDATE

Save parent	Saves/updates children too	Children not saved unless explicitly
Update child field	Auto-saved if parent saved	Ignored unless saved separately



---

Conclusion:

CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE is a Hibernate-only feature.

Behaves like PERSIST + MERGE.

Very helpful when you want auto-save behavior for children on parent save/update.

Let me know if you want a code snippet using SAVE_UPDATE, or proceed to a final summary chart of all cascade types.
