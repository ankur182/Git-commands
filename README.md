Great question! Let's break this down in simple words.

From your image, the Employee class has:

@ManyToOne  
@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")  
@JsonBackReference  
private Employer employer;

This means:

You're telling Hibernate: "In the employee table, create a foreign key column called employerId that links to the primary key of the employer table".



---

Now, what if you try to use @JoinColumn(name = "panNo") or location, etc.?

Case 1: @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") ✅ (CORRECT)

employerId must be the @Id (primary key) in Employer.

Hibernate creates the relationship using the employerId column.

Everything works fine — no errors.


Case 2: @JoinColumn(name = "panNo") ❌ (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Hibernate tries to link employee.panNo to employer.panNo.

But panNo is not a primary key or a unique column (by default).

This may cause:

Error: “Cannot reference non-primary key column” unless you make it @Column(unique = true) and set @JoinColumn(referencedColumnName = "panNo")

Or unexpected joins/bugs in data mapping



Case 3: @JoinColumn(name = "estDate") or location ❌

Same issue: Hibernate can't join on non-unique, non-primary columns.

It doesn't know how to uniquely identify the parent.



---

If You REALLY Want to Join on panNo

You must do this:

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "panNo", referencedColumnName = "panNo")
private Employer employer;

And in the Employer class:

@Column(unique = true)
private String panNo;

But again — not recommended unless panNo is truly a unique, never-changing ID (like an Aadhaar, PAN, etc.)


---

Best Practice

Always use:

@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")

Because:

It’s the primary key

Auto-generated and indexed

Avoids relational mapping errors

Summary Table

Join Column	Works?	Why / Why Not

employerId	Yes	Primary key in Employer, default and best choice
panNo	Maybe	Only works with @Column(unique = true) and referencedColumnName
estDate / others	No	Not unique or primary — can’t reliably map child to parent


Let me know if you want to test this in Postman or see how Hibernate generates the DB table for each

Let’s take your code and see what really happens when we use different @JoinColumn(name = "...") values in the Employee entity.

We assume:

You are using Spring Boot + JPA + Hibernate

Employer has: employerId (PK), panNo, estDate, location

You POST data via Postman

You're using H2/MySQL or some relational DB



---

Case 1: @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") — (DEFAULT & CORRECT)

@JoinColumn(name = "employerId")

Output/Result:

A column employer_id is created in employee table

That column is a foreign key to employer(employerId)

You can save Employer + Employee in a single call if cascade is set.

In Postman: You POST an Employee JSON with an embedded Employer, and it works.


Example Table Output:

employeeId	name	salary	employer_id

1	Ram	50000	101


employerId	panNo	estDate	location

101	AB12345	2020-01-01	Delhi



---

Case 2: @JoinColumn(name = "panNo")

@JoinColumn(name = "panNo", referencedColumnName = "panNo")

Requirements:

panNo must be unique in Employer.java:

@Column(unique = true)
private String panNo;


Output/Result:

Hibernate adds a column pan_no in employee table

It references employer(panNo)

It works ONLY if panNo is unique

If panNo is not unique or null, you'll get an error


Postman JSON:

{
  "name": "Shyam",
  "salary": 50000,
  "employer": {
    "panNo": "AB12345"
  }
}

Error if not handled:

> org.hibernate.MappingException: Unable to find referenced column 'panNo'...




---

Case 3: @JoinColumn(name = "location") or estDate

@JoinColumn(name = "location", referencedColumnName = "location")

Output/Result:

Hibernate will try to use location or estDate as FK

But since they are not unique, it can’t figure out a correct join

App will throw runtime error on save/fetch


Typical Error:

> org.hibernate.AnnotationException: referencedColumnNames(location) of Employee.employer referencing Employer not mapped to a single property




---

What Happens in DB Schema for Each Case

Join Column	FK Column in employee Table	Works?	Error Message (If Any)

employerId	employer_id (FK to PK)	Yes	None
panNo	pan_no (FK to unique col)	Maybe	Works only if @Column(unique = true) applied
location	location	No	Mapping/Constraint errors
estDate	est_date	No	Not allowed — ambiguous/non-unique



---

Recommendation:

Always use @JoinColumn(name = "employerId") unless you have a guaranteed unique alternative.

Would you like to try one case together with an actual JSON and see what response Postman gives?
